How to Create a Custom Dataset for a ML Model
=============================================

This guide walks you through dataset creation (frame selection + annotation) and training a custom YOLO-based model.

1) Decide what model you want to train
--------------------------------------

Before creating an annotation dataset, decide which type of task you want to train.
At the moment, we support **YOLO-based models** (Ultralytics), such as detection, segmentation, or pose.

Browse the supported tasks here:
`Ultralytics YOLO Tasks <https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/>`_

.. tip::
   Your choice here affects how you annotate:

   - **Detection** → bounding boxes
   - **Segmentation** → polygons/masks
   - **Pose** → keypoints

2) Plan your dataset and choose videos
--------------------------------------

Pick videos that represent the full variability of what you want the model to handle.
The goal is to avoid training on a narrow “best-case” subset.

- Include different backgrounds, lighting, camera angles, and distances.
- Include easy and hard examples (small targets, partial visibility, motion blur, reflections, etc.).
- Try to cover all relevant environments and recording conditions.

3) Create an annotation dataset (extract frames + label)
--------------------------------------------------------

The first practical step is to create an annotation dataset. This means:
extracting a set of frames from your videos and drawing labels around the target(s) of interest.

Common annotation tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- `Roboflow <https://roboflow.com/>`_ Fast and user-friendly.

.. note::
    Roboflow has a free version, but uploaded data becomes **public** (visible in the “Roboflow universe”). New accounts typically include **14 days of private projects**. `Roboflow Setup Guide <https://github.com/albiangela/TRex-tutorials-data/blob/main/Roboflow-annotations_and_YOLO-training_tutorial.pdf>`_

Alternatives - if you need the data to remain fully local:

- **CVAT** (local or self-hosted)
- **Label Studio** (local or self-hosted) - `tutorial <https://alexhang212.github.io/YOLO_Behaviour_Repo/annotation.html>`_

Frame extraction recommendations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **Extract ~25-30 frames per video** as a starting point.
- It can help to extract more than needed, then select frames to annotate roughly at random.
- Annotate frames from most videos (don't concentrate on just a few).

Annotation guidelines
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Label **all visible targets** in each frame (or all visible parts, if partially occluded).
- Make bounding boxes **tight** around the target with as little background as possible.
- Be consistent in how you treat partial visibility and edge-of-frame cases.

.. note::
   Consistency matters, the same visual scenario should be labeled the same way across the dataset.
   This reduces confusion for the model and usually improves performance.

4) Export the dataset in YOLO format
------------------------------------

Once annotation is complete, export your dataset in a YOLO-compatible format.
Most tools offer an export option for YOLO/Ultralytics.

- Keep a clear ``train/val/test`` split (usually 70%/20%/10% of the annotated dataset).
- Verify that labels align with images after export (spot-check a few samples).

5) Training a model
-------------------

After exporting, you can train a custom YOLO-based model using Ultralytics.

- Training instructions:
  `Model Training Documentation <https://trex.run/docs/model_training.html>`_
- Custom Colab notebook (with extras like label changes and tiling):
  `Custom Training Colab Notebook <https://github.com/albiangela/train-custom-YOLO-Colab>`_

.. note::
   If your targets are small, tiling can help. You can tile images before annotation or tile annotated images before training (for example using the Colab notebook above).
   In TRex, you can enable tiling during detection, if you trained a tiled model.

6) Iterate
----------

Dataset building is iterative. After your first training run:

- Inspect mistakes (false positives/negatives) and add frames that represent those failure cases.
- Balance the dataset if one condition dominates (e.g., only one background or one viewpoint).
- Repeat: annotate → retrain → evaluate.

If anything is unclear or you run into issues during setup, annotation, or export, let us know.
